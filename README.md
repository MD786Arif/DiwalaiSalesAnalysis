# Diwali Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This GitHub repository hosts a Python-based data analysis project centered around Diwali sales data. The analysis employs Python for data manipulation and analysis, with a primary focus on the `pandas` library for data handling and `seaborn` for data visualization.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **data**: Raw Diwali sales data in CSV format.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis (e.g., `Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`).
- **src**: Python scripts for data processing and analysis (e.g., `diwali_sales_analysis.py`).
- **visualizations**: Output directory for visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the notebooks)
- Required Python libraries: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

Install the necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

### Running the Analysis

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diwali-sales-analysis.git
cd diwali-sales-analysis
```

2. Run the main analysis script:

```bash
python src/diwali_sales_analysis.py
```

Alternatively, open and run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb
```

## Analysis Highlights

- **Data Cleaning**: The raw data is processed and cleaned to handle missing values and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilize pandas for data manipulation and seaborn for visualizations to explore patterns and trends in Diwali sales data.
- **Visualizations**: Various visualizations, such as line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps, are generated using seaborn to convey insights effectively.

## Results and Conclusions

The analysis uncovers key insights into Diwali sales patterns, helping identify successful products, peak sales periods, and customer preferences. The visualizations in the `visualizations` directory offer a clear representation of the findings.

## Future Work

Potential future enhancements for the project:

- Incorporate additional data sources for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Implement machine learning models for sales prediction.
- Improve visualization aesthetics and add interactive elements.
